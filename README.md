# dEval-flask Submodule

The "dEval" project includes the Git submodule "dEval-flask". Below is a quick guide on how to clone this repository as a submodule within the larger "dEval" repository with the submodule "dEval-flask" cloned as a subdirectory within it and then update the submodule pointer when changes are made.

## Cloning the Repository with Submodules

When you clone the repository, include the submodules with one of the following methods:

### Method 1: Clone with Submodules

Clone the repository and initialize the submodule in one step:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules <repository-url>
```

### Method 2: Initialize After Cloning

If you cloned the repository without the `--recurse-submodules` flag, initialize and update the submodules with:

```bash
git pull
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

This command will initialize and update all submodules in the main repository, including nested submodules (if there are any).

## Updating the Submodule

The submodule is linked to a specific commit in the main repository. Even if you make changes within the submoduleâ€™s own repository, those changes will not be reflected in the main repository until you update the submodule pointer. Follow these steps to update it:

1. **Navigate to the submodule directory:**

   ```bash
   cd <path/to/submodule>
   ```

2. **Pull/Merge the latest changes in the submodule:**

   ```bash
   git pull
   ```

   If the submodule is set to track a specific branch, you might need to switch branches. Note that I plan to always use the "main" branch to populate the submodule.

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull
   ```

3. **Return to the main repository's root directory:**

   ```bash
   cd ../..
   ```

4. **Stage the submodule update:**

   ```bash
   git add <path/to/submodule>
   ```

5. **Commit the change in the main repository:**

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Update submodule pointer to latest commit"
   ```

6. **Push the commit:**

   ```bash
   git push
   ```
## Pulling new code if you weren't the one that updated the submodule pointer
###(this will be most users)

Either:

1. **Accomplish in one step by executing:**

   ```bash
   git pull --recurse-submodules
   ```
   
Or:

2.  **In two steps (say, if you forgot and you just did a "git pull" initially):**

   ```bash
   git pull
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```

## Summary

- **Cloning:** Use `--recurse-submodules` for a new clone or initialize/update submodules manually after cloning if the `--recurse-submodules` flag was not used initially.
- **Updating:** Update the submodule directory and then stage and commit the change in the main repository. Until you do this, the main repository will continue to reference the older commit.
- If you don't care about the flask server, then don't worry about it, though.  You can always pull down the submodule at a later date using the steps above if you change your mind.
